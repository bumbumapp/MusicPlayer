/**
 * A data representation of a library tab.
 * A tab can come in two moves, [Visible] or [Invisible]. Invisibility means that the tab
 * will still be present in the customization menu, but will not be shown on the home UI.
 *
 * Like other IO-bound datatypes in Auxio, tabs are stored in a binary format. However, tabs cannot
 * be serialized on their own. Instead, they are saved as a sequence of tabs as shown below:
 *
 * 0bTAB1_TAB2_TAB3_TAB4_TAB5
 *
 * Where TABN is a chunk representing a tab at position N. TAB5 is reserved for playlists.
 * Each chunk in a sequence is represented as:
 *
 * VTTT
 *
 * Where V is a bit representing the visibility and T is a 3-bit integer representing the
 * [DisplayMode] ordinal for this tab.
 *
 * To serialize and deserialize a tab sequence, [toSequence] and [fromSequence] can be used
 * respectively.
 *
 * By default, the tab order will be SONGS, ALBUMS, ARTISTS, GENRES, PLAYLISTS
